              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

              createDeployment:
                description: |-
                  CreateDeployment specifies whether the Executor wants the SpinKube operator
                  to create a deployment for the application or if it will be realized externally.
                type: boolean
              deploymentConfig:
                description: |-
                  DeploymentConfig specifies how the deployment should be configured when
                  createDeployment is true.

                      CACertSecret specifies the name of the secret containing the CA
                      certificates to be mounted to the deployment.

                    description: |-
                      InstallDefaultCACerts specifies whether the default CA
                      certificate bundle should be generated. When set a new secret
                      will be created containing the certificates. If no secret name is
                      defined in `CACertSecret` the secret name will be `spin-ca`.

                  runtimeClassName:
                    description: |-
                      RuntimeClassName is the runtime class name that should be used by pods created
                      as part of a deployment. This should only be define when SpintainerImage is not defined.
                    type: string
                  spinImage:
                    description: |-
                      SpinImage points to an image that will run Spin in a container to
                      execute your SpinApp. This is an alternative to using the shim to execute
                      your SpinApp. This should only be defined when RuntimeClassName is not
                      defined.
